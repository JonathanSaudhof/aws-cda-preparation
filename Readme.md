I decided to challenge me and started learning for the AWS certificate. FreeCodeCamp offers
a tutorial where they introduce the needed knowledge and experience

## 1 Docker Full Stack App

Following the tutorial I realized, that you need to know how docker works and how you deploy with docker.
So I started watching another tutorial on docker and developed a little fullstack app (React, Node, MongoDB)
to practice what I have learned. It was really excited and now I understand docker much better.
